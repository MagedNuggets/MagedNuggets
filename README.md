# Hi! Wellcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹
Hello i'm @MagedNuggets, or just **Nathan**. I've been programming since I was 8.
I started with HTML, then Python, and now Java, (Mostly Java) .
I also make like to do random projects like the potato website thing: https://magednuggets.github.io/Potato/

If you want an explanation of the name of my profile, it was like 5 months ago,  i wanted to distribute to my friends a fake ransomware that woudnt do anything exept for opening a rick roll video. and the guy i wanted to give the fake ransomware is called, **Maged**. He also liked **Chicken Nuggets**. So i named it **MagedNuggets**.

I have multiple projects going on at the moment, the biggest one being Koursoh Client, a pvp client (like lunar client or badlion client).
